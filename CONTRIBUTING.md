# Contributing to TrainYourOwnYOLO

Contributions are highly appreciated. If you'd like to make a contribution, please:

 1. Fork the repo and make all changes on your own fork. 

 1. Once you are happy with your new feature do the following:

    * Apply [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting  

    * Make sure you have as few commits as possible. For a small feature, there should only be a single commit.

    * Rebase off the upstream/master branch to avoid merge conflicts.

    * Test your feature on as many different system configurations as possible. The three major operating systems are Windows, Linux and macOS. For each, try to test the feature with and without using a GPU,
    
    * Test *all* existing feature with your new code (your change should not break existing features). 

 1. Create a pull request to the upstream/master branch. The pull request must include:

    * A description of the new feature,
    
    * A minimal test example that uses the new feature,
    
    
    * A list of tested system configurations (OS and GPU model if used).

 1. Once the PR is created, wait for feedback and incorporate suggested changes. 

 1. That's it!
    * Once the PR is merged, you are an official contributor of TrainYourOwnYOLO. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³
